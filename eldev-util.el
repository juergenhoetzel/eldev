There are additional variables `executable' and `command-line'
bound to actual values (evaluated macro arguments).  Return value
is that of the BODY.  If BODY is empty, return the process' exit
code.

Also, eat up several options from BODY if present:

    :pre-execution FORM

        Form to evaluate before launching the child process.  See
        also `:trace-command-line' below.

    :trace-command-line MESSAGE

        If non-nil, trace the command line before executing.  The
        value can also be a string or a form that evaluates to
        one (replaces the default message).

    :destination DESTINATION

        Use given destination (evaluated) instead of the
        defaults.  See function `call-process' for details.

    :infile FILE

        Fetch input from given file (evaluated).

    :die-on-error FLAG

        Die with an `eldev-error' if the child process exits with
        anything but zero code.  Can also be a string or a form
        evaluating to one, in which case it is used instead of
        the executable name.  Process output is also printed with
        `eldev-warn'."
