;;; Commentary:

;; Eldev (Elisp Development Tool) is an Emacs-based build system,
;; targeted solely at Elisp projects.  It is an alternative to Cask.
;; Unlike Cask, Eldev itself is fully written in Elisp and its
;; configuration files are also Elisp programs.  If you are familiar
;; with Java world, Cask can be seen as a parallel to Maven — it uses
;; project description, while Eldev is sort of a parallel to Gradle —
;; its configuration is a program on its own.

;; Eldev is a command-line utility that runs Emacs in batch mode.
;; Therefore, you should not (or at least need not) install it in your
;; Emacs.  Instead, use one of the following ways.

;; If you have a catch-all directory for executables.
;;
;; 1. From this directory (e.g. `~/bin') execute:
;;
;;      $ curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/doublep/eldev/master/bin/eldev > eldev && chmod a+x eldev
;;
;; No further steps necessary — Eldev will bootstrap itself as needed
;; on first invocation.

;; If you don't have such a directory and don't care where `eldev'
;; executable is placed.
;;
;; 1. Run:
;;
;;      $ curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/doublep/eldev/master/webinstall/eldev | sh
;;
;;    This will install eldev script to ~/.eldev/bin.
;;
;; 2. Add the directory to your $PATH; e.g. in ~/.profile add this:
;;
;;      export PATH="$HOME/.eldev/bin:$PATH"
;;
;; Afterwards Eldev will bootstrap itself as needed on first
;; invocation.

;; For further help and more ways to install, please see the homepage:
;;
;;   https://github.com/doublep/eldev

        Declare an option for the specified COMMAND or a list of

A cleaner *must not* delete anything on its own.  Instead, it
must evaluate to a filename (string) or a list of filenames which
should be deleted.  A filename in the list can also specify a
directory, in which case the directory is removed with its
contents (i.e. recursively).

Filenames should usually be relative, in which case they are
resolved based on project directory.  However, it is allowed to
return absolute paths for special needs (but standard cleaners
never do this).

BODY can contain the following keywords:

    :name NAME

        Cleaner name (a symbol) for the command line.  Default
        value is derived from function name by removing `eldev-'
        prefix (or a prefix for any other project) and word
        `cleaner-'.

    :aliases ALIASES

        One (a symbol) or several (list of symbols) aliases for
        the cleaner.

    :briefdoc STRING

        Use STRING as brief (one-line) documentation for the
        cleaner.  By default it is derived from the function
        docstring.

    :default VALUE

        Whether the cleaner should be invoked by default,
        i.e. when `eldev clean' is issued without further
        command-line arguments.

    :only-explicit VALUE

        If non-nil, this cleaner is not invoked by `clean all',
        i.e. it must be explicitly named.

    :superseded-by CLEANERS

        Don't invoke this cleaner if one of CLEANERS (which must
        be a symbol or a list of those) is also going to be

SELECTORs can be used to choose tests to run among the loaded
ones.  Multiple are combined as `or' operation: all tests that
match any of the specified selectors are executed.  When used in
combination with `--file', they result in `and' operation: only
those tests that are loaded and match the selectors are executed.

Usually, this function should be of no interest: custom builders

However, it is allowed to use this function as described below.

By default, list of all dependencies, i.e. across all possible
dependency finders, is returned.  However, if argument FINDER is
specified, returned list includes dependencies only for that
finder.

Returned list's elements look like (TYPE DEPENDENCY [...]).
Following types (symbols) are currently defined:

    up-to-date) before TARGET is built;

  - inherits: TARGET inherits all sources (which become
    `depends-on' dependencies) and dependencies of DEPENDENCY;
    this is less strict than `depends-on';

For future compatibility, callers should treat any unknown type
as `depends-on'.  It must not assume anything about contents of
the elements past the two described values.

Returned list must not be modified.  Instead, use function

(eldev-defcommand eldev-targets (&rest parameters)
  "Show tree of building targets in the project.  Out of the box
Eldev defines rules to byte-compile `.el' files, generate `.info'
from `.texi' files and build Elisp packages.  These are combined
into `:compile', `:package' and `:package-archive-entry' virtual
targets.  Each project can additionally define more targets in
its `Eldev' file.

Every project will also have virtual target `:default', possibly
empty.

Targets that additionally serve as sources to other targets are
always shown.  Other sources (e.g. `.el' files) can be shown or
not, depending on `--sources', `--concise' and `--no-sources'
options.  In concise mode, if a target has several sources, at
most three of them are listed in one line.

In case `--dependencies' option is specified, lines starting with
[...] show target dependencies:

  [dep]: hard dependency: this must be built before the main
         target;

  [inh]: main target inherits dependencies and sources (which
         also become dependencies) from the one it depends on.

However, dependencies are listed only if they are known.  Usually
this means that you need to compile the project once — then Eldev
will know changes in which `.el' files might require
recompilation of seemingly unrelated `.elc'."
